# QD Dectection
The repository is consist of the 0.5 and 1 um QD image files and the labeled session using MATLAB image labeler, 
There are several stages for the project, for now we are thinking about:
1. Cascade object detector
2. CNN training

The Repo now contain the script for COD, the CODTraining.m is working just, but need more negative examples to have more stages(more stages it has, more accurate the result is)
but teh HGDetectImage.m is not working right now and I amdealing with the load functionality on matlab.

Will update again soon
