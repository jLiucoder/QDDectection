# QDCounting
The repository is consist of the 0.5 and 1 um QD image files and the labeled session using MATLAB image labeler, 
There are several stages of the project, for now we are thinking about:
1. Cascade object detector
2. CNN training

The Repo will contain the script for COD once it's fully functional for the first step.
